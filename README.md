# InheritanceGame
Basic Java game, being created for a school project. Mostly just a 'proof-of-concepts' project.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

# Stable Branch:
Least buggy version, meant to be the branch I use to show my teacher progress.

# Experimental Branch:
Branch I will periodically commit to with 'half-way complete' changes.

# (Hopefully not for long) Unstable Branch:
I'm removing gradle entirely from my project, it seems like it can be really nice, but I'm literally not using it. Also makes it easier for me to run files / move my project between my school IDE and vscode at home.
